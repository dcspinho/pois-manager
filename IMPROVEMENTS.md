# Service for managing Points of Interest

This document outlines the changes and improvements that could be made to enhance the maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices of the backend services.

## Improvements

### 1. Tests for the remaining cases

- **Why**: Currently, some services and controllers lack comprehensive test coverage. Increasing test coverage will ensure better reliability and confidence in the code.
- **Action**: Implement unit tests (for individual pieces of logic) and integration tests (for ensuring different parts of the system work together) for all services and controllers.

### 2. Entity for currency rate

- **Why**: Keep the logic implemented and add a DTO (Data Transfer Objects) for `CurrencyRate` would ensure clear data representation and help with validation, serialization, and transformations of currency-related data.
- **Action**: Create a `currencyRate.dto.ts` file that mirrors the structure of the entity and includes necessary validation rules to ensure that only valid data is processed.

### 3. Entity validation rules

- **Why**: Although DTOs handle most of the validation, it's important to also ensure that the entities themselves have validation rules, especially for critical fields. This ensures that the data remains valid even if it's manipulated directly at the entity level, bypassing the DTO layer. For example, in the case of the POI status, should be ensured that only specific values such as `ONLINE`, `OFFLINE`, or other valid statuses are stored in the database by applying validation rules at the entity level.

- **Action**: Use TypeORM decorators such as `@IsEnum` to enforce validation rules on the entity. This ensures that when the data is persisted, only valid values are stored. This can prevent inconsistencies in the database and add an extra layer of protection.

### 4. Best approach for currency rate

- **Why**: The current currency rate handling could be improved to manage external data sources more efficiently.
- **Action**: Consider creating a service that integrates with external APIs (such as a currency exchange service) and periodically updates the currency rates in the database. This process should be asynchronous to avoid blocking operations.

### 5. Best approach for opening hours

- **Why**: Managing opening hours can be tricky, especially with varying formats and schedules.
- **Action**: Design an `OpeningHours` service that supports more complex time ranges (e.g., multiple intervals per day, time zone management).

### 6. Pagination

- **Why**: Efficient pagination is critical when dealing with large datasets, such as POIs (Points Of Interest) or fuel products. Without proper pagination, requests may return large amounts of data, leading to performance issues and inefficient resource usage.
- **Action**: Implement pagination on all API endpoints that return lists of resources. This includes adding query parameters for `limit` and `offset` or using cursor-based pagination. Ensure that pagination follows REST principles for consistency in the API design.

### 7. Data type verification

- **Why**: Ensuring that the data provided to services and controllers is of the correct type is crucial to avoid unexpected errors and maintain consistency within the system.
- **Action**: Implement type validations for all DTOs using libraries or native TypeScript features. This ensures that data received by the APIs is of the expected type, minimizing runtime errors and automatically validating input data.

### 8. Migrations and rollbacks

- **Why**: Proper management of database migrations is essential to ensure the schema evolves consistently across all environments (development, staging, production). Additionally, the ability to rollback a migration is crucial to avoid potential issues or data corruption during deployment.
- **Action**: Ensure down methods are implemented in all migration files. These methods should reverse the changes made by the up migrations, enabling the ability to rollback schema changes in case of issues.

### 9. Cascade deletion for related entities

- **Why**: In cases where a parent entity (e.g., POI) has related entities (e.g., Pump), deleting the parent entity without cascading the deletion can leave orphaned records in the database, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Action**:
  - Review the relationship to ensure proper cascade deletion is enabled;
  - Ensure that cascading is only applied where necessary. If not all relations should be cascaded, should be consider handling deletions manually for those cases;
  - In case of needed to preserve some related data, consider using soft delete for more flexibility.

- **Note**: In some cases, cascading can have performance impacts if large sets of related data are being deleted. Shoul be analyzed the database performance to ensure that cascading doesnâ€™t lead to bottlenecks or timeouts.

### 10. Better error handling

- **Why**: Improve resilience by handling different types of errors, ensuring meaningful feedback and that the system logs all critical failures appropriately.
- **Action**: Add a centralized error-handling mechanism with custom error classes. These should capture errors and return standardized error messages, which helps debugging.

### 11. Logging and monitoring

- **Why**: Logs are essential for understanding application behavior, especially when diagnosing issues or understanding system performance.
- **Action**: Add structured logging (e.g., Morgan) to log important events, errors, and user interactions. Integrate a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus) to gain insights into performance metrics and alerts.

### 12. Necessary and important comments in tricky parts

- **Why**: Tricky or complex sections of code can be difficult to understand or maintain. Adding clear, necessary comments helps clarify intentions, complex logic, or potential pitfalls in certain areas of the codebase.
- **Action**: Identify sections of code that involve complex business logic, difficult-to-follow algorithms, or custom solutions, and add clear comments explaining why specific approaches were taken.

- **Note**: Comments should not clutter the codebase but instead provide additional context in areas where the logic may not be immediately clear. Over-commenting can reduce readability, so the new comments should focus on explaining complex sections only.

### 13. Dockerize the backend application

- **Why**: Containerizing the backend application ensures consistency across different environments (development, staging, production), simplifies the deployment process, and allows for better scalability and isolation of dependencies.
- **Action**:
  - Update the `Dockerfile` for the Node.js backend service to define the container's environment, including necessary dependencies;
  - Update the `docker-compose.yml` file if multiple services (e.g., backend, database) need to run in isolated containers;
  - Ensure that the container runs efficiently by minimizing the image size and considering multi-stage builds for better performance;
  - Test the containerized application to verify it runs as expected in a Docker environment.
